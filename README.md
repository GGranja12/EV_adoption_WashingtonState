## The Project
Hi! I am delighted to present you my Electric Vehicles Charging related business case, supported by data gathered from a free electric vehicle API.
The main goal is to provide the user broader insights regarding the Washinton State's electric vehicle adoption and state of the art so that one may be able to answer the following questions:
  #### Where to start expanding the EV charging infrastructure within the Washinton State?
  #### Which kind of EV charging infrastructure should be developed?
Check the presentation to find out the main conclusions: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGT2wCgM54/_L_i3XAJpZv3CgFSvO95uw/view?utm_content=DAGT2wCgM54&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor

Feel free to explore, but keep in mind that in order to request data from the API you need to subscribe it (still applicable to free subscription): https://rapidapi.com/adrienpelletierlaroche/api/electric-vehicle-data2
